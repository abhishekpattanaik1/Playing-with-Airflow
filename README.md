- Will be using docker compose to bring up the apache airflow and create DAG.
  command to bring up apache airflow docker-compose up -d

  This is inspired from the Marc Lamberti's The-complete-hands-on-course-to-master-apache-airflow available in Udemy.
# Apache Airflow(https://airflow.apache.org/)
Apache Airflow is an open-source workflow management platform for data engineering pipelines. It started at Airbnb in October 2014 as a solution to manage the company's increasingly complex workflow. 
- Different version of apache airflow provided by different cloud provider i.e Amazon provided its managed version of apache airflow(Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA)).
- We should opt for apache airflow in case of more complex workflow / pipelines etc.
